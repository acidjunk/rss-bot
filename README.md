RSS to Twitter bot
==================

Very WIP; sorry no fancy intro yet. Feel free to open a PR.

Running tests:
```
$ py.test # or execute py.test from any sub folder in unit_tests/
$ pt.test -n auto
```

You'll need a binary (or self compiled) version of [tweet-hs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tweet-hs).

Binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows can be found: [here](https://github.com/vmchale/command-line-tweeter/releases).
